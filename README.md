# EscaPy

EscaPy is a **thoroughly tested** tool that **reliably** and almost
**exhaustively** interprets the ESC/P and ESC/P2 command sets defined by Epson
([Wikipedia - Epson ESC/P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/P)), then converts
the data formerly intended for printers into a modern PDF file.

## :information_source: About the Project

**TL;DR**: Your DOS system or emulator will be able to produce searchable
PDF files.
This tool is compatible with files produced by the
[Libre Printer](https://github.com/ysard/libre-printer) interface discussed below.


## :book: Foreword

Nowadays, older equipment may still be in use in sectors such as medical or
industrial (machine tools). While the software of the old days were often
designed to use dot-matrix printers exclusively, these printers can break down
or can no longer be used due to a lack of consumables available on the market.

As a result, the entire system has to be replaced without justification.

EscaPy generates PDF files from the raw data sent to the printer.
Files can therefore be stored permanently, printed on new hardware, indexed by
an archiving system (text remains accessible) or simply consulted at any time.

Note that data destined for the printer must be captured in some way.
The [Libre Printer](https://github.com/ysard/libre-printer) project accomplishes
exactly this task by providing a software and hardware interface pretending
to be a printer compatible with older hardware.


## :bank: Donations

EscaPy is a project that took ~2 months of full-time work and 12k+ lines
including documentation & tests, for its first version.

- [x] **Advanced font support**

    Specify in advance the fonts you wish to use. 14 different fonts can be
    specified, each in 2 versions (fixed and proportional fonts), for a total of 28 fonts.

    Use system-installed or custom fonts.

    Text enhancements (strikethrough, underline, highlight, etc.) are supported.

    </figure></div>


- [x] **Several rendering modes for graphic commands**

    Points can be rendered as dots or rectangles.
    In all cases, the file is vectorized (infinitely scalable).

    NB: Rendering as an image is not yet available, but such a result can be
    obtained with GhostScript for this task (see examples).


- [x] **Searchable text**

    Text remains as text, not as images.
   This makes content search and indexing possible.


- [x] **Wide range of encodings available**

    A major effort has been made to ensure that the essential encodings of this
 era and more, are also supported by EscaPy. It's easy to add to this list.
 Contributions are welcome.
 <br><br>
    Characters that can be printed in the place of the intervals dedicated to
 control characters, and international characters (National Replacement
 Character Set) are also injected into the encoding tables.

      <img src="./images/encodings.webp"><br>

 character sets.

- [x] **Page formats**

    47 portrait formats and their landscape equivalents are predefined.
    Custom sizes are also available.


- [x] **User-defined characters support (ESC/P2 only)**

    A user can send customized bitmap characters to the printer.
    A mapping file will be generated to map the received characters to modern
    unicode codes (see examples).


- [x] **Enhanced reliability thanks to testing (~100%)**

    EscaPy is an implementation of a standard made up of over 600 pages
    covered by almost 300 tests.

    A coverage rate close to 100% eliminates most of the erratic behavior that
    a non-rigorously tested application can produce.

    However, a coverage rate of 100% does not guarantee that the program
    rigorously follows the standard, but that its behavior is most often in line
    with what the developer expected when he designed it.


- [x] **Facilitated development**

    The code is fully documented to facilitate maintenance and enhancements.


## ‚öô Setup

### Installation

All operating systems should be supported, although this project is mainly
developed for a GNU-Linux system as an everyday computer.

Simple installation from PyPI :
```bash
$ pip install esca-py
```

Installation from sources :
```bash
$ pip install .
```

Install the project in editable mode for developpers :
```bash
$ make install
# Or
$ pip install -e .[dev]
```

Installation on Debian :
- Download the `.deb` file in the [releases section of this repo](https://github.com/ysard/escapy/releases).
- Then :
```bash
apt install ./escapy_1.0.0-2_all.deb
```


### Usage

```bash
$ escapy -h
usage:  [-h] [--pins [PINS]] [--single_sheets | --no-single_sheets] [-o [OUTPUT]]
        [-c [CONFIG]] [-db [USERDEF_DB_FILEPATH]] [-v]
        esc_prn

positional arguments:
  esc_prn                ESC raw printer file. - to read from stdin.

options:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  --pins [PINS]          number of needles of the print head (9, 24, 48). Leave it unset
                         for ESCP2 modern printers. (default: unset)
  --single_sheets, --no-single_sheets
                         single-sheets or continuous paper. (default: single-sheets)
  -o [OUTPUT], --output [OUTPUT]
                         PDF output file. - to write on stdout. (default: output.pdf)
  -c [CONFIG], --config [CONFIG]
                         configuration file to use. (default: ./escapy.conf,
                         ~/.local/share/escapy/escapy.conf)
  -db [USERDEF_DB_FILEPATH], --userdef_db_filepath [USERDEF_DB_FILEPATH]
                         mappings between user-defined chararacter codes and unicode.
                         (default: ./user_defined_mapping.json)
  -v, --version          show program's version number and exit
```

NB : The configuration file supplied by the application contains all the
information needed to configure the virtual printer (margins, page formats, etc.),
fonts and folders.

### Examples

Standard input/output streams are active, so it is possible to chain tools :

```bash
$ cat my_file.prn | escapy - -o - > my_pdf.pdf
```

For example, to convert the generated PDF into a TIFF image with GhostScript :

```bash
$ cat my_file.prn | escapy - -o - | \
gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER \
-dNoSeparationFiles -dSimulateOverprint=true -sDEVICE=tiffsep -r720 \
-sOutputFile=out-%d.tiff -
```

## :newspaper: Configuration file

The configuration file supplied by the application contains all the information
needed to configure the virtual printer (margins, page formats, etc.),
fonts and folders.

By default, the `escapy.conf` file is searched for in the current folder.
If it doesn't exist, it is searched for in the standard software configuration
folder on your system (see below).
This folder is created if it doesn't already exist.

On GNU/Linux systems:
`~/.local/share/escapy/`

On Windows systems:
`C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\escapy`

On MacOS systems:
`/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/escapy`

The default file is in the repository folder: [data](./escapy/data/).

## :abc: Fonts

For reasons of licensing and personal preference, EscaPy does not embed fonts
(except for a minimal version of Courier and Helvetica).

Noto, FreeFont and Fira fonts are normally installed on most systems, but can also be
installed manually with the following command (on Debian systems and derivatives):

```bash
$ apt install fonts-noto fonts-freefont-ttf fonts-firacode
```

The same goes for Liberation fonts:
```bash
$ apt install fonts-liberation
```

Windows proprietary fonts can be installed with the following command:
```bash
$ apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
```

More generally, think of the `fnt` tool as a package manager for managing and
installing fonts.

## :a: User-defined characters

A JSON file is created and updated when custom characters are found.
The user must specify the desired character in the unicode character set.
The changes will be applied to the PDF by restarting the software.

Example:
```
{
    "83e1a70_1": {
        "mode": 1,
        "proportional_spacing": false,
        "scripting": null,
        "1": "\ufffd"
    }
}
```

Here, a character is defined under the unique key `83e1a70_1`;
the character with code `1` in the table is momentarily associated with
the undefined character `\ufffd` (`UNDEFINED`).

A modification to match this code with the character `‚ô´` could be as follows:
```
{
    "83e1a70_1": {
        "mode": 1,
        "proportional_spacing": false,
        "scripting": null,
        "1": "‚ô´"
    }
}
```

By default, the JSON file (`user_defined_mapping.json`) is created in the current
folder, but this can be changed in the configuration file.
A folder containing the image of the bitmap character received can also be created.

## :u7a7a: Unsupported encodings (Chinese, Japanese, etc.)

The ESC/P and ESC/P2 standards do not seem to support Chinese or Japanese
languages (encodings were apparently not provided for). However, some language
evolutions (ESC/POS, ESC/P-K, ESC/P J84) and printers do support this.
While in theory these languages can be implemented, their documentation remains
hard to find and is beyond the scope of the current project.
See [Wikipedia - ESC variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/P#Variants).

The easiest way to achieve this is to use the printer in graphics mode
(raster or bitimage) instead of text mode.


## :trophy: Acknowledgements

- The management of modern fonts and their display on our screens would not
have been possible without the work of French engineer
[Pierre B√©zier (1910-1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier),
who also, through his work at Renault, revolutionized computer-aided design (CAD).

- The Epson-Seiko teams of the 90's deserve our thanks for producing complete
documentation of the language interpreted by their printers.


## Absence of acknowledgements

Since the 2010s, Epson-Seiko (like so many other brands) tends to no longer publish
language evolutions or advanced technical specifications for their machines.
The brand tends to consider that this is now an industrial secret and none of
your business.

In an ethical world, we wouldn't have to decipher these proprietary protocols.
If you too feel that this is not appropriate, then you should consider
manufacturers who respect your right to repair/modify what you own.
